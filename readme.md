#Responsive Device Testing

This project will be a script/bookmarklet to let you test your responsive web design on multiple device dimensions.

Script supports iOS devices described below ... more to come.

##Files

###rdt.js
This is the javascript file that you can add to any project.  The library is a self-executing function, so just call rdt.go(). 

###bookmarklet.htm
Just open this file in your browser and add the link to your bookmark bar.  Most browsers will let you drag the link to the bookmark bar to create the bookmarklet.

If you already have the bookmarklet installed on your browser, make sure you delete the old one before installing the new one.

###Devices
Currently the following devices have been added to the script:
* iPhone - Portrait and Landscape
* iPhone 5 - Portrait and Landscape
* iPad - Portrait and Landscape


More coming soon!
