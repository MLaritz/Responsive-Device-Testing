#Responsive Device Testing

This project will be a script/bookmarklet to let you test your responsive web design on multiple device dimensions.

Script currently resizes your site to 320px x 480px.

##Files

###rdt.js
This is the javascript file that you can add to any project.  The library is a self-executing function, so just call rdt.go(). 

###bookmarklet.htm
Just open this file in your browser and add the link to your bookmark bar.  Most browsers will let you drag the link to the bookmark bar to create the bookmarklet.


More coming soon!
